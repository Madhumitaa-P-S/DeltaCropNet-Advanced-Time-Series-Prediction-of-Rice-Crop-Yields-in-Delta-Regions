#### **Phase 3: Yield Prediction**
*The final phase predicts crop yield and production by integrating all previous forecasts.*
- **Input:** Historical Yield/Production Data + Historical Weather & NDVI Data (2000-2019), and the Predicted Weather & NDVI for 2020 from Phases 1 and 2.
- **Process:** The model is trained to understand the complex relationship between environmental factors and final yield.
- **Output:** The predicted Rice Crop Yield and Production for the year 2020.
