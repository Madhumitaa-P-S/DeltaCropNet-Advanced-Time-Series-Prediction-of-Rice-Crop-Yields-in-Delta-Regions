#### **Phase 1: Weather Prediction**
*This phase focuses on predicting future weather parameters essential for crop growth.*
- **Input:** Historical weather data (2000-2019)
- **Process:** Trains GRU, LSTM, and RNN models to forecast weather for the target year (2020).
- **Output:** Predicted weather parameters for 2020, which are used as input for Phase 2.
